IOT-based-Medicine-Reminder-Alarm-using-DS3231-RTC-Module-and-16x2-LCD-with-Arduino-Uno-
AIM:

The aim of this project is to design and develop a Medicine Reminder Alarm system using Arduino Uno, a DS3231 Real-Time Clock (RTC) module, and a 16x2 LCD display. This system intends to assist individuals in managing their medication schedule by providing timely reminders.

OBJECTIVES:

Real-Time Clock Integration: Utilize the DS3231 RTC module to accurately maintain and retrieve the current time and date.

User-Defined Medication Schedule: Enable users to set specific medication schedule times using pushbuttons.

Alert System: Implement a visual and auditory alert mechanism using the 16x2 LCD display and a buzzer to remind users of their medication schedule.

Display Relevant Information: Display the current time, date, and medication reminder messages on the LCD screen.

User Interaction: Allow user interaction for acknowledgment or confirmation of the medication reminder.

FEATURES:

Customizable Medication Schedule: Allow users to input their medication schedule using buttons, a keypad, or a user interface. Users can set the time(s) for medication reminders.

Confirmation/Acknowledgment: Include buttons for users to acknowledge that they've taken their medication. This confirmation could clear the current reminder or mark it as complete.

Battery Backup: Implement a backup power source (like a small battery) for the RTC module to ensure that the schedule is maintained even during power outages.

Adjustable Reminder Frequency: Allow users to set how often the reminder should repeat, whether it's a daily reminder, multiple times a day, or a weekly reminder for certain medications.

Automatic Time Adjustment: Utilize the RTC module's capability to automatically adjust for daylight saving time or changes in the real-time clock.
